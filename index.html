<h2>AMIGA Future Composer reference player</h2>

<p>
Above XMMS plug-in is based on a
reference player which has been implemented
because hardly any FC player available on PC (and not even on AMIGA)
manages to play back all modules without flaws (if at all). On PC, I
don't know any. With other implementations, there is always at least
one song that reveals a minor or major bug during playback. If that
would happen with this particular implementation, it would be very
easy to fix the source code, whereas it would be very difficult to
fix an emulated MC680x0 machine code binary-only player.
</p>
<p>
However, please don't submit any damaged files or the well-known FC
modules like <b>Astaroth</b> or <b>Chambers of Shaolin</b> which
contain several independent sub-songs and must not be played from
beginning till end. Those sub-songs ought to be initialized and
played separately. Prepared versions of these individual sub-songs
have been made available for download on this page further below.
Feel free to delete your old all-in-one version of Astaroth. It is
to be used in the original game only.
</p>
<p>
Contrary to the information given in the documentation files that
come with Future Composer &lt;=1.3 on AMIGA, FC is not based on a
music player by David Whittaker. Although this misleading
information had been corrected with the original release of Future
Composer 1.4, the wrong information has been passed on with modified
releases and by other people and is archived with music collections
on CD, for instance. <i>[That's the primary reason why this page comments
on this credit issue, too. In earlier versions of this page I haven't
mentioned the correction in FC 1.4. Sorry about that. Thanks to all
those who've bugged me about it.]</i>
</p>
<p>
The great music in the game Astaroth was made by <b>Jochen Hippel</b>
of Atari ST and Thalion fame. And it was Jochen's music player, too,
which served as the ground work for the development of the Future Composer
editor on AMIGA.
</p>
<p>
David Whittaker has confirmed that he did not made the music, and he
has never given/licensed his AMIGA players to any commercial company
except for the games he was working on himself.<br>

<b>Did you know...?</b>
<p>
...that the original FC player source code contained lots of bugs
which led various programmers to publish bug-fixes which had the
side-effect of introducing unwanted incompatibilities?</p>
<p>...that there are many modified or hacked tunes respectively
which have been used in demos or intros and hence are just
duplicates?</p>
