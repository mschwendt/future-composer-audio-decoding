xmms-fc -- http://sourceforge.net/projects/xmms-fc/

This XMMS plug-in is based on an unmaintained piece of code which is
my `Future Composer Reference Player for Linux'. Because the source
code has been imported into CVS long since its last modification,
the timestamps of the files in CVS do not reflect that the core code
has not been worked on for years.

See FC.README in the source directory for more about that code. You
can get the original package at:

  http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Lakes/5147/mod/#fc

That player has been written because most FC player implementations
(on AMIGA and/or PC) do not manage to play back all modules without
flaws. There is always at least one module that reveals a minor or
major bug during playback. If that would happen with this particular
implementation, it would be very easy to fix the source code,
whereas it would be very difficult to fix an emulated MC680x0
machine code binary-only player.

If you still happen to encounter unexpected behaviour, please send
your bug report to <sidplay AT geocities DOT com> or submit it here:
